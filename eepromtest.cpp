     * types it will be called with. The type is denoted between <>. The pre-compiler
     * checks which types the function/template is called with
     * and just duplicates the function for each of those.
     * So if we call this from our code:
     * MyStruct t; get<MyStruct>(0, t);
     * The precompiler turns the template into this function for us:
     * const MyStruct &get(int idx, MyStruct &t)
     * If we call the template with more types/structs, it just repeats the function for each.
