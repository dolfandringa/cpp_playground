//Lets take a simple array of 8 16-bit (2 byte) integers (written in hex notation)
//as you know, numbers can be written in binary, decimal, hexadecimal and octal notation.
//We normally use decimal (0-9), but hexadecimal (0-F) is a little easier with computers
//since the 16 numbers you can represent with 0-F are exactly 4 bits = 1/2 a byte = 1 nibble.
//So with 2 hexadecimal numbers you can represent 8bits = 1 byte.
//In hexadecimal notation, the 0x is used to denote that it actually IS hexadecimal notation,
//but the 0x doesn't mean anything to the value. So 0x4241 just means a hexadecimal number
//of 4241. 
//In python you can easily convert between the notations, for instance with
//`python -c "print(0x4241)";` Which will tell you that the decimal equivalent.
//and `python -c "print(bin(0x4241))";` will tell you the binary equivalent.
